/* -----------!Game description!-----------

This game idea (not following the description in the compendium), is a game where the goal is pure and simple survival.
There will hopefully (if there's time) be animals which you should avoid to survive, using the SWITCH buttons on the board to move around on the map displayed on the display.
The map will (again, hopefully if we finish on time), consist of rivers, bushes, trees and rocks.
The goal of the game is to move as far as possible (distance, not amount of steps) away from the starting point.
Ideally, the map should automagically generate "new" areas as you move around, but let's see how far we get with that.
The LEDs on the board will be indicators of your current health/hunger.
